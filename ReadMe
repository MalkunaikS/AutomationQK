* Automation Testing Assignment *
  step 1:
- Create Maven project

  step 2: 
- Update that add dependencies in POM.xml (selenium, test Ng dependency).

- For Given Task I have selected "Open Cart" Application to perform given validation which includes 3 task.
- I have created Packeges under src/test/java. the first package which "pageobject" includes class basepage, homepage, accountregistrationpage etc.      
  the BasePage under pageObjects which includes only constructor which is common in every pageobject class so I have created a seperate class to reuse in every pageobject. 
  This will be invoked by every Page Object Class constructor (Re-usability).
- Base class contain @beforeclass and @Afterclass method which includes browser setup and tear down method which is again common in evey testcases so here i have created seperate package as 
  "Baseclass"   extends this in every child class.
  
 
 Steps by step process :
 Create Page Object Classes for HomePage, RegistrationPage  under pageObjects package. (These classes extends from BasePage).
 Create AccountRegistrationTest under "testCases"
 Create BaseClass under testBase package and copy re-usable methods.
